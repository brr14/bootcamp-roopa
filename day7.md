# RFID/NFC
This was an interesting session where we learnt about how car keys, contactless payments happen. 
We also learnt about high frequency and low frequency card.
## NFC (Near Field Communication)
We learnt about the different modes of communication namely active and passive wherein the active mode of communication enables both the target and the 
initiator devices to have power supply in order to communicate with each other whereas in passive mode of communication the initiator has to generate 
radio signal to communicate with the target device.
## RFID
### Proxmark3
We learnt about this RFID tool which is used to snoop, listen from low frequency to high frequency tags.
