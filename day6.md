# IQ SIGNAL
They form the basis of complex RF signal modulation and demodulation, both in hardware and in software, as well as in complex signal analysis
They are used in RF signal applications.A pair of periodic signals are said to be in “quadrature” when they differ in phase by 90 degrees. The 
“in-phase” or reference signal is referred to as “I,” and the signal that is shifted by 90 degrees (the signal in quadrature) is called “Q.”
Information is “carried” by an RF carrier through the process of modulation. The information signal (voice, data, etc.) is used to alter the properties 
of the RF signal (see also: RF signal generators). A simple example is Amplitude Modulation, or AM.For AM, the information signal is used to alter, 
or modulate the amplitude of the carrier.
