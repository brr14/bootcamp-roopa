# Firmware Analysis
We were given a brief introduction on what firmware is and then we learnt about reverse engineering. This was an interesting and difficult topic to start
with, this was introduced to basically detect any malware activity and how we could deal with same.
We also learnt about different data structures particularly stack and it's implementations using various operations like push,pop,etc.
Memory allocation was also taught where we learnt about different pointers such as base pointer, stack pointer,etc in a stack data structure.
