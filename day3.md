# Automotive Security
This was a very interesting session where we learnt how to control a vehicle using online simulators like change it's speed or open doors.
We used the ICSIM software for the same.
## Task-1
(a) Get familiar with the CAN-Utils

(b) Sniff out the CAN packets and analyse the changing bits.

(c) Dump all CAN packets and save it to file.

(d) Replay attack- Play the previously captured packet.
## Result
First I got familair with the CAN-Utils and was able to figure the changing bits by analysing the bits that changed as I was swapping controls on 
the controller.
